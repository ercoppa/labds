## How to (re)generate HTML slide file for a notebook

Given a `.ipynb` file:
- Generate once:
```
bash scripts/process.sh <file>.ipynb
```
- Watch changes and regenerate:
```
bash scripts/run.sh <file>.ipynb
```

Then open the related HTML file with your browser. There is no hot reload in the browser, hence, you have to manualy refresh the page to see the new changes.

2. Open HTML with the browser
3. Add at the end of the URL: `?print-pdf`
4. Print the page

## Issues

- The slides are not compliant with LUISS guidelines wrt branding, e.g., using the suggested slide template, font, etc. I have made a hack to use the LUISS font but then disable it since the LUISS font is kind of inconsistent with respect to other fonts that we use (e.g., for code). 

## JypyterBook [WIP]

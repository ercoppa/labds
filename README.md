## How to (re)generate HTML slide file for a notebook

Given a `.ipynb` file:
- Generate once:
```
bash scripts/process.sh <file>.ipynb
```
- Watch changes and regenerate:
```
bash scripts/run.sh <file>.ipynb
```

Then open the related HTML file with your browser. There is no hot reload in the browser, hence, you have to manualy refresh the page to see the new changes.

## How to (re)generate the PDF file for a notebook

1. Generate HTML file (see above)
2. Open HTML with the browser
3. Add at the end of the URL: `?print-pdf`
4. Print the page

## Issues

- We could add a GitHub action to automatically generate the HTML file.
- When redistributing the `ipynb` files on LUISS Learn, the image url will not work. We need to fix this by using fixing the URL by adding the prefix `https://ercoppa.github.io/labds/`. We should to this automatically with a GitHub action.
- The slides are not compliant with LUISS guidelines wrt branding, e.g., using the suggested slide template, font, etc. I have made a hack to use the LUISS font but then disable it since the LUISS font is kind of inconsistent with respect to other fonts that we use (e.g., for code).
